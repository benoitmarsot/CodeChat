We utilize AI to help save time, money and build credit.Save TimeOur applications learn common use patterns from our users and suggest faster ways to manage finances e.g. the typical user pays the same bills, phone and sends money to the same people every month, so our software learns these patterns and when ever a user loads money, we suggest a single click, confirmed of course, to repeat common payments all in one step – the combined payment might also earn the customer more loyalty points and help build credit. Save MoneyDifferent providers charge different service fees so we run algorithms that check if combining common payments will save money and suggest bundles where overall service fees are lower. If we notice a customer is having difficulty and perhaps is trying the same option many times but is consistently having to go back or re-enter information we will proactively suggest help instead of waiting for the same issue to arise.Save For the futureWe look at the financial history of our customers and suggest ways to earn interest or use their money to earn money e.g. over 6 months we find that a customer buys the same phone plan but has to top up more frequently as they run out of minutes or data, so we suggest better plans which offer more for the same or less money. Similarly, if a customer consistently pays late and incurs late fees, however has a small balance at the end of each month, we suggest moving extra cash into a separate account that can be used to pay bills just before they are due and save money.The Numbers You Need To Know60MILLIONUnbanked US Households630BILLIONGlobal Remittances each year1.3BILLIONUnbanked Customers worldwide78PERCENTPopulation which prefer to bank using mobile applicationTHE UNBANKED MARKETWe serve the 1.1b unbanked and underbanked populations who do not have a bank accountINFORMATIONHomeSolutionsApplicationEcoSystemAboutContactNewsLearn MoreYour Cash DigitallyCONTACTinfo@cashx.aiREGIONAL OFFICESNashville, TNMiami, FLCambridge, UKDubai, UAEPune, IndiaJohannesburg, South AfricaHEADQUARTERS550 West B Street, Fourth Floor, San Diego, CA 92101FOLLOW US
